# Mechanical Counter

A browser-based **mechanical-style counter** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It visually mimics classic mechanical tally counters or odometers using simple front-end logic.

## Features

- Increment counter
- Decrement counter
- Reset counter
- Mechanical-style visual effect
- Fully client-side (no backend)
- Works in all modern browsers

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure  
- **CSS3** – styling & transitions  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – logic & DOM manipulation

---

## How It Works

The counter value is stored in JavaScript and updated through button interactions.  
Each change updates the display to simulate a mechanical counting motion rather than a plain number update.
